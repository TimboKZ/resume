\section*{Work Experience}

\subsection*{Amazon \hfill \textcolor{CompanyLocationText}{London, UK} \\ \colorbox{RoleBackground}{Software Development Engineer} \hfill September 2019 - Present}

\begin{specialitemize}
    \item \textcolor{SubtleText}{(Dec 2019 - Present)} As a member of the Video Quality Analysis team at Prime Video:
    
    \begin{specialitemize}
    	\item Worked on debugging and optimizing machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Designed DevOps and MLOps pipelines.  Used \textbf{Python}, \textbf{OpenCV}, \textbf{MXNet}, and various \textbf{AWS} services.
        \item Decreased analysis algorithm latency from 4x to 2x the video duration on average by replacing expensive OCR service calls with a custom convolutional neural network trained for algorithm's needs.
        \item Increased video analysis system throughput from 10s to 100s of parallel analysis jobs by leading the design and implementation of a new serverless backend.
        %\item Decreased the number of bugs and crashes in production by educating peers on static typing in Python and adding linters and type checkers to CI/CD pipelines.
    \end{specialitemize}
    
    \item \textcolor{SubtleText}{(Sep 2019 - Dec 2019)} As a member of the Living Room Client team at Prime Video:
    
    \begin{specialitemize}
    	\item Worked on improving the frontend for the Prime Video TV app. Used \textbf{Typescript} and \textbf{React} with \textbf{Redux}.
        \item Introduced pointer control support to Prime Video TV app, which was initially designed to only support D-pad, by revamping how component focus and section transition animations were handled.
        \item Improved animation performance in edge cases from 5fps to 30fps by optimizing React updates.
        %\item Improved overall performance of the application by educating peers with Java background on the inner workings of React and relevant optimization techniques.
    \end{specialitemize}
\end{specialitemize}

\subsection*{Amazon Lab126 \hfill \textcolor{CompanyLocationText}{Cambridge, UK} \\ \colorbox{RoleBackground}{Software Development Intern} \hfill June 2018 - September 2018}

\begin{specialitemize}
	\item As a member of the Camera team in the Hardware \& Architecture department:
    \begin{specialitemize}
	    \item Developed a tool for real-time relighting of poorly-lit images based on sparse depth maps using \textbf{C++}, \textbf{OpenCV} and \textbf{Godot}. The tool showed promising results and was picked up for further productization.
        \item Considerably sped up team's depth map analysis and 3D simulation efforts by rewriting the in-house 3D engine as a plugin for the Godot game engine with a custom C++ backend.
    \end{specialitemize}
\end{specialitemize}

\subsection*{UCL Surgical Robot Vision group \hfill \textcolor{CompanyLocationText}{London, UK} \\ \colorbox{RoleBackground}{Research Intern} \hfill July 2017 - September 2017}

\begin{specialitemize}
	\item Developed the first openly documented Microsoft HoloLens system for overlaying holograms over surgical tools, using infrared markers and external IR trackers. Used \textbf{C\#} for HoloLens and \textbf{Python} for backend.
	\item Published \href{https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.03274}{a paper} that was accepted for oral presentation at the 2018 SPIE Medical Imaging Conference, and has since been cited 15 times, putting it into top 25\% cited papers.
\end{specialitemize}

\subsection*{Microsoft, UCL Institute of Child Health \hfill \textcolor{CompanyLocationText}{London, UK} \\ \colorbox{RoleBackground}{Intern Team Lead} \hfill June 2017 - August 2017}

\begin{specialitemize}
	\item Supervised a team of interns developing a system for \href{https://fizzyo.github.io/}{Project Fizzyo}, used for analysis of cystic fibrosis patient data. Fizzyo has since won several awards and produced over 10 papers (incl. a paper for NeurIPS).
	\item Personally developed a frontend-agnostic API backend using \textbf{Node.js}, \textbf{Express.js} and \textbf{PostgreSQL}. The backend is used to this day with minimal changes, collecting anonymised data from over 160 child patients.
\end{specialitemize}
